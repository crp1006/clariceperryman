### Current Projects
1. Characterizing pathways and potential of CH~4~ oxidation in thawing permafrost peatlands using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics
2. Effect of woody encroachment on belowground CH~4~ cycling in northern peatlands
3. Constraining environmental controls and seasonal variation in the effect of methanotrophy on stable isotope signatures of CH~4~ 

### Past Projects
1. __Master's project:__ Assessing geochemical controls on methane oxidation in thawing permafrost; [Perryman et al., 2020; _JGR Biogeosciences_](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JG005526) 
2. __Undergrad project:__ Impact of historical agriculture on calcite precipitation and pedogenesis in desert soils; [read more here](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cuag.12241?fbclid=IwAR2OjBvRfMkLfhBn88jV-UoSQ5S7mBNaBVkkiYL5DDYjSWnrKefuQGwvMyQ)
3. __Assesing stock of heavy metals in Arctic soils__: Synthesized publicly availble data on heavy metals in soils above 60Â°N, identified key data gaps in public record of these data and priorities for future work on heavy metal storage in permafrost-affected soils [Perryman et al., 2020; _PLOS ONE_](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233297)
