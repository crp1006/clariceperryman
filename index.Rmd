__PhD Candidate, University of New Hampshire Natural Resources & Earth Systems Science Program__ 
<br>__Dissertation Topic:__ Climate change impacts on methane oxidizing bacteria in northern peatlands  
<br>I'm a member of the [Trace Gas Biogeochemistry Lab Group](https://eos.unh.edu/earth-systems-research-center/research-earth-systems-research-center/about-trace-gas-biogeochemistry-group) in the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space at the University of New Hampshire. My graduate research incorpoarates biogeochemistry and microbial ecology to investigate how climate change will impact methane-oxidizing (consuming) bacteria in northern peatlands. I'm an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, and a co-coordinator of the [UNH Women in Science](https://twitter.com/UNH_WIS), and part of the 2020 [AGU Voices for Science](https://www.agu.org/Share-and-Advocate/Share/Sharing-science-network/Voices-for-science) cohort.
